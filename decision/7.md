## Issue

There has never been any easy way to test out experimental features on WET. If anyone was to create a new CSS class or JavaScript plugin on WET, they would have to test it on their local machine, constraining its exposure amongst other things.

There are also numerous of other reasons to come up with this approach, such as: 

* Coming up with more relevant features to add to the toolkit.
* Increasing the amount of contributions from the WET community and expanding it.

To circumvent that, the WET community came up with a solution.

## Proposed solution

Every new GCWeb release now contains a set of experimental features. In order to use any of the features, whether it is a CSS class or a Javascript plugin, one can simply wrap such feature around an element containing the ".experimental" class.

With that solution, a contributor can easily add new features to GCWeb to try them out and a publisher/developer can easily implement them on any page.

### Important notices

The experimental features approach is designed to try new things that could eventually make it to the standard/stable version of GCWeb or WET, not to brake their progress or to diverge without any supervision. In that sense, if proper documentation for a plugin or a style doesn't come sometimes after its release as an experimental feature, it will eventually be dropped instead of making it to the standards.

Experimental features are unstable and are to be used at your own risk.

* The availability of each feature is going to be discussed and re-evaluated during the last [roadmap meeting](../roadmap-en.html) before a release of GCWeb. The withdrawal of an experimental feature will be notified one release in advance. This statement means that the publisher of a page containing experimental features has to check out for new releases in order to make sure that the experimental feature(s) being used is/are still going to be available upon next release.
* Documentation and/or working example(s) for those features can be incomplete or unavailable.

An overall [documentation page on experimental features](https://wet-boew.github.io/themes-dist/GCWeb/experimental-en.html) and their current statuses is also available.

### Temporary features

This solution works great with temporary features that would be needed only for a certain period of time and that should not be used afterwards.
