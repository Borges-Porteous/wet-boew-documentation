## Issue

There has never been any easy way to test out experimental features on WET. If anyone was to create a new CSS class or JavaScript plugin on WET, they would have to test it on their local machine, constraining its exposure amongst other things.

There are also numerous of other reasons to come up with this approach, such as: 

* Coming up with more relevant features to add to the toolkit.
* Increasing the amount of contributions from the WET community and expanding the community.

To circumvent that, the WET community came up with a solution.

## Proposed solution

Every new WET release now contains a set of experimental features. In order to use any of the features, whether it is a CSS class or a Javascript plugin, one can simply wrap such feature around an element containing the ".experimental" class.

With that solution, a contributor can easily add new features to the WET to try them out and a publisher/developer can easily include experimental features to any page.

### Important notices

Experimental features are unstable and are to be used at your own risk.

* Features availabilities are going to be re-evaluated at every release. The withdrawal of an experimental feature will be notified one release in advance. This statement means that the publisher of a page containing experimental features has to check out for new releases in order to make sure that the experimental feature(s) being used is/are still going to be available upon next release.
* Documentation and/or working example(s) for those features can be incomplete or unavailable.

An overall documentation page on experimental features and their current statuses is also available.

### Temporary features

This solution works great with temporary features that would be needed only for a certain period of time and that should not be used afterwards.
