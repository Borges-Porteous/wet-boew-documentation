## Issue

Provide guidance on how to include JSON-LD structured data along with other structured marked up with RDFa or RDFa Lite in a single web page.

## Background

Structured data has been implemented in the wet-boew theme since the first version of WET 4.0. Schema.org is the preferred vocabulary and RDFa Lite is the preferred notation language to markup Web documents. A minimal and generic implementation was included in the wet-boew template and gcweb template to identify the WebPage thing and it's properties such breadcrumb, mainContentOfPage, name, and the date modified. Recently GCweb theme was enhanced to include structured data to specify the publisher and to explicitly define the typeof of mainContentOfPage.

Nowadays, content provider has expressed the need to add some structured data, without being limited, to support richer search result and to provide meaningful information for voice assistant.

Some major search engine, such Google, recommend to use JSON-LD to associate the structured data over other notation such as RDFa or microdata which is also supported.

It is important to notes that is possible and valid according to W3C specification to create structure data by using various notation such JSON-LD, RDFa, Turtle, Microdata... which can be then translated into a Resource Description Framework (RDF) statements or RDF graph. Also, there is plenty ways to create linking between the data. Establishing the data relationship is defined by the notation and by the vocabulary used.

## Challenges

Combining multiple notation increase the risk of having some data integrity issue. The structured information should not contradict itself and should not contradict with other meta data that use an alternative representation outside the scope of the structured data.

There is some structure data which is easier to codify by using RDFa Lite and other structure data which is easier to codify by using JSON-LD. Both notation has their advantage.

Interlinking the JSON-LD structured data with the RDFa structured data. Both notation has a way to create a in-page reference and they can be interlinked by using some schema.org property.

Delimit the structured data that belong to the template container versus the structured data for the page content.

Only tag the pertinent structured data information.

## Guidance on structure data

* Provide structured information that are conforming to the specification and vocabulary used.
* Provide complementary information and avoid contradiction information.
* Provide up-to-date information.
* Provide original content that you or your users have generated.
* Don't mark up content that is not visible to readers of the page.
* Don't mark up irrelevant or misleading content, such as fake reviews or content unrelated to the focus of a page.
* Don't use structured data to deceive or mislead users.
* Don't create broken reference.
* Don't duplicate the structured content, try to use link instead.

## Solution

This is a baseline template solution. It assume your are going to add more structured data in the JSON-LD script bloc. Otherwise, the JSON-LD script bloc should be removed completely from the page to avoid confusion of providing partial data.

This example assume your web page served at the URL "http://example.com/page.html".

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html class="no-js" lang="en" dir="ltr">
	<head>

		&hellip;

		<script type="application/ld+json">
		{
		  "@context": "http://schema.org",
		  "@id": "#json-ld",
		  "sameAs": "#wb-main"
		}
		</script>

		&hellip;

	</head>
	<body vocab="http://schema.org/" typeof="WebPage">

		&hellip;

		<main property="mainContentOfPage" typeof="WebPageElement" resource="#wb-main" class="container">

			&hellip;

		</main>

		&hellip;

	</body>
</html>
```

Structured data reference:
* http://example.com/page.html - The WebPage thing
* http://example.com/page.html#json-ld - The thing represented by JSON-LD
* http://example.com/page.html#wb-main - The thing represented by the HTML main element

Thing:
* WebPage

In the JSON-LD script, the property [http://schema.org/sameAs](http://schema.org/sameAs) indicate a relative reference to the main element marked up with RDFa Lite to unambiguously indicates that both define structured data for the same thing and they should been seen as complementary. An equivalent property that could be use is ```owl:sameAs```.

Note: The structure data that use the RDFa notation share the same URL as the structure data that use the JSON-LD notation. Using an identifier (@id) for JSON-LD is the easy way to unambiguous both notation.


### JSON-LD script alternative equivalent notation

```
<script type="application/ld+json">
	{
	  "@id": "#json-ld",
	  "http://schema.org/sameAs": "#wb-main"
	}
</script>
```

```
<script type="application/ld+json">
	{
	  "@id": "#json-ld",
	  "schema:sameAs": "#wb-main"
	}
</script>
```

```
<script type="application/ld+json">
	{
	  "@context": "http://schema.org",
	  "@id": "#json-ld",
	  "sameAs": "http://example.com/page.html#wb-main"
	}
</script>
```

```
<script type="application/ld+json">
	{
	  "@context": "http://schema.org",
	  "@id": "http://example.com/page.html#json-ld",
	  "sameAs": "#wb-main"
	}
</script>
```

```
<script type="application/ld+json">
	{
	  "@context": "http://schema.org",
	  "@id": "http://example.com/page.html#json-ld",
	  "sameAs": "http://example.com/page.html#wb-main"
	}
</script>
```

```
<script type="application/ld+json">
	{
	  "@id": "http://example.com/page.html#json-ld",
	  "http://schema.org/sameAs": "http://example.com/page.html#wb-main"
	}
</script>
```

```
<script type="application/ld+json">
	{
	  "@id": "http://example.com/page.html#json-ld",
	  "schema:sameAs": "#wb-main"
	}
</script>
```

```
<script type="application/ld+json">
	{
	  "@context": {
	    "schema": "http://schema.org",
		"foaf": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/"
	  }
	  "@id": "http://example.com/page.html#json-ld",
	  "schema:sameAs": "#wb-main"
	}
</script>
