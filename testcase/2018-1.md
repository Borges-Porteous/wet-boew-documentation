Test page to evaluate AT when heading is present in summary elements.

## Summary

A single heading element is allowable as the content of a `<summary>` element in the [HTML 5.1 specification for summary](https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/interactive-elements.html#the-summary-element):

> **Content model:**
> Either: phrasing content.
> Or: one element of heading content.

However, browser and screen reader support for this is inconsistent.

## Expected behaviour

The expand / collapse should work identically to when a heading is not present in the summary
* Activating a collapsed summary should expand it.
* Activating an expanded summary should collapse it.
* Summaries show in buttons list.
* The expanded / collapsed state should be voiced by the screen reader
* The expanded / collapsed state should show in the buttons list
* An expand / collapse action should be voiced by the screen reader

Additionally, a summary with a heading should appear in the headings list.

## Vanilla HTML example

### Code

```
<details>
  <summary>
    <h3>
      h3 within summary
    </h3>
  </summary>
  <p>
    Details body paragraph
  </p>
</details>
```

### Demo

{% raw %}
<details>
  <summary>
    <h3>
      h3 within summary
    </h3>
  </summary>
  <p>
    Details body paragraph
  </p>
</details>
{% endraw %}

### Results

| Browser + AT            | In headings list | In buttons list | Expandable | Collapsible | State voiced | Expansion voiced | Collapse voiced |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ---------- | ----------- | ------------ | ---------------- | --------------- |
| Expected Behaviour      | Yes              | Yes             | Yes        | Yes         | Yes          | Yes              | Yes             |
