Test page to evaluate AT when heading is not present in summary elements.

## Summary

Detail / summary is a standard pattern for expand / collapse behaviour in the [HTML 5.1 specification for summary](https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/interactive-elements.html#the-summary-element).

Including only plain text (not headings) in the summary has consistent implementation across browsers and AT.

## Expected behaviour

The expand / collapse should work as follows
- Activating a collapsed summary should expand it.
- Activating an expanded summary should collapse it.
- Summaries show in buttons list.
- The expanded / collapsed state should be voiced by the screen reader
- The expanded / collapsed state should show in the buttons list
- An expand / collapse action should be voiced by the screen reader

## Vanilla HTML example

### Code

```
<details>
  <summary>
      Plain text within summary
  </summary>
  <p>
    Details body paragraph
  </p>
</details>
```
### Demo

{% raw %}
<details>
  <summary>
      Plain text within summary
  </summary>
  <p>
    Details body paragraph
  </p>
</details>
{% endraw %}

### Results
| Browser + AT            | In headings list | In buttons list | Expandable | Collapsible | State voiced | Expansion voiced | Collapse voiced |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ---------- | ----------- | ------------ | ---------------- | --------------- |
| Expected Behaviour      | No               | Yes             | Yes        | Yes         | Yes          | Yes              | Yes             |
