## Summary of tests

`<detail>` / `<summary>` is a standard pattern for expand / collapse behaviour in HTML 5.1.

A single heading element is allowable as the content of a `<summary>` element in the [HTML 5.1 specification for summary](https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/interactive-elements.html#the-summary-element):

> Content model:
> Either: phrasing content.
> Or: one element of heading content.

However, browser and screen reader support for this is even less consistent than with only plain text in the summary (which is also poor).

## Expected behaviour

The expand / collapse should behave as follows:

* Summaries show in buttons list.
* The expanded / collapsed state should show in the buttons list.
* Activating a collapsed summary with the keyboard should expand it.
* Activating an expanded summary with the keyboard should collapse it.
* The expanded / collapsed state should be voiced by the screen reader
* An expand / collapse action should be voiced by the screen reader.

Additionally, a summary with a heading should appear in the headings list.

See [WAI-ARIA Accordion](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#accordion) design pattern.

## Test cases

* [Test case 1: Heading in summary element](../testcase/2018-1.html)
* [Test case 2: Plain text in summary element](../testcase/2018-2.html)

NVDA 2018 was used to test along with the three major supported browsers: Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer 11.

### Results for test case 1: Heading in summary element

None of the browsers tested matched the expected behaviour. \* indicates that behaviour is quirky. See notes below.

| Browser + AT            | Headings list    | Buttons list    | Expandable / collapsible | State voiced | Expansion / collapse voiced |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ------------------------ | ------------ | --------------------------- |
| Expected                | Yes              | Yes             | Yes                      | Yes          | Yes                         |
| Chrome 67               | Yes              | Yes             | Yes \*                   | Yes          | Yes \*                      |
| Firefox 61              | Yes              | Yes             | Yes \*                   | Yes          | No                          |
| IE 11                   | Yes              | No              | No                       | No           | No                          |

#### Quirks
* Chrome will collapse and expand as expected when activated by mouse click, but not with keyboard.
* Chrome will voice expansion / collapse but only when clicking the icon, not the heading text.
* Firefox will collapse and expand as expected when activated by mouse click, but not with keyboard.
* Firefox will produce strange behaviour (window switching, etc) when activating with keyboard.

### Results for test case 2: Plain text in summary element

Only Chrome matched the expected behaviour.

| Browser + AT            | Headings list    | Buttons list    | Expandable / collapsible | State voiced | Expansion / collapse voiced |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ------------------------ | ------------ | --------------------------- |
| Expected                | No               | Yes             | Yes                      | Yes          | Yes                         |
| **Chrome 67**           | No               | Yes             | Yes                      | Yes          | Yes                         |
| Firefox 61              | No               | Yes             | Yes                      | Yes          | No                          |
| IE 11                   | No               | No              | No                       | n/a          | n/a                         |


## Suggestion: Javascript enhancement

Inspired by [accessible expanding / collapsing sections](http://www.mit.edu/~rjc/aria/expandingSections.html).

The HTML markup is identical to the vanilla example above, apart from the addition of a [javascript file](./assets/details.js) and [css file](./assets/details.css). The native `detail` and `summary` elements are replaced onload with `div` and `button` elements respectively, and the expected behaviour is implemented on click and keydown events.

(Note that the `button` element must be nested **inside** the heading element.)

## JS enhancement: test cases

* [JS enhancement test case 2: Plain text in summary element](./assets/test2.html)
