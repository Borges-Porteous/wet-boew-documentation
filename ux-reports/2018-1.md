## Wireframe tested

Desktop view: 

![Desktop wireframe]({{ "2018-assets/2018-1-2.png" }})

Mobile view image:

![Mobile wireframe]({{ "2018-assets/2018-1-3.png" }})


[HTML source code](2018-assets/2018-1-1.html)

### Notes

The results, as showed in the bottom of the screen capture, was showing more information when the user click on the expand/collapsae link illustrated with the arrow.

The data was loaded from an external JSON file.

Each meter for the category A was also a link to apply filter.

Between the displayed result and the filtering options, there is a tag cloud allowing to remove a previously applied filter.

### Findings

* User didn't realized that the block of button for the category B was a way to filter the result in the table bellow. Idem with the filter for the Category A represented by the meter.

## Proposed improved wireframe 

Remove the button for applying the filter for the Category B

Put in the left side of the result, a filter didicated section.

Keep only one coded user interface for mobile view and desktop view

Move the free text filter, in the top of filter area instead of just before the results.
